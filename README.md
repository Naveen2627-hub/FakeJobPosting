#**Fake Job Posting Prediction**

**Problem Definition**
"Fake Job Posting Prediction" is a data mining project that aims to uncover and flag fake job listings on 
online job boards and recruitment websites. This project will employ a blend of natural language 
processing, machine learning, and web scraping methods to gather and examine data from job postings. 
Natural language processing techniques will be used to analyze the job descriptions for signs of fraud, 
such as unrealistic promises of pay and benefits or inconsistent information. Additionally, machine 
learning algorithms will be trained to detect patterns in the data that are indicative of fake job postings, 
such as certain keywords or phrases that are commonly used in scam postings. Finally, the system will be 
tested and evaluated to ensure that it can accurately identify and flag fake job postings with a high degree
of accuracy. There are several challenges that may arise in this project such as, Data availability and quality, evolving 
fraud tactics, High class imbalance, False positives, Privacy and security, and keeping the model updated.

**Data Source**
The first step of the project will involve web scraping job postings from various websites to collect a large 
dataset of job postings. We found a dataset in Kaggle in the link below.

**Data Description**
The above dataset consists of 18 attributes and 17880 rows of data which consists of columns such as job 
description. The data will be pre-processed to extract relevant features such as job title, company name, 
location, and job description.
